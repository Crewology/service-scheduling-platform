## Phase 1: Foundation and Database Schema

**Objective:** Design and implement the complete database schema to support a multi-sided marketplace connecting customers with service providers across 42 categories.

**What was built:**

The database schema was designed with 14 tables in `drizzle/schema.ts` and pushed via `pnpm db:push`. The tables are:

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Core user accounts with role-based access | `role` enum: customer, provider, admin |
| `service_providers` | Provider business profiles | businessName, businessType, verificationStatus, stripeAccountId, commissionRate |
| `service_categories` | 42 predefined service categories | name, slug, isMobileEnabled, isFixedLocationEnabled, isVirtualEnabled |
| `services` | Individual services offered by providers | pricingModel (fixed/hourly/package/custom_quote), depositRequired, durationMinutes |
| `service_photos` | Photo gallery for services | photoUrl, caption, sortOrder, isPrimary |
| `availability_schedules` | Recurring weekly availability | dayOfWeek (0-6), startTime, endTime, maxConcurrentBookings |
| `availability_overrides` | Date-specific schedule changes | overrideDate, isAvailable, reason |
| `bookings` | Customer-provider booking records | bookingNumber, status (7 states), pricing breakdown, location details |
| `payments` | Stripe payment tracking | stripePaymentIntentId, paymentType (deposit/final/full/refund) |
| `reviews` | Customer reviews with provider responses | rating (1-5), reviewText, responseText, respondedAt |
| `messages` | Booking-linked messaging | conversationId, senderId, recipientId, isRead |
| `notifications` | Multi-channel notification records | notificationType, isSentEmail, isSentSms |
| `verification_documents` | Provider identity/license verification | documentType, verificationStatus, expirationDate |

All 42 service categories were seeded into the database with IDs matching the project specification (e.g., BARBER SHOP = ID 7, HANDYMAN = ID 9, MASSAGE THERAPIST = ID 10, etc.).

**Database indexes** were added on all foreign keys and frequently queried columns (provider ratings, booking status+date, category active+sort order, etc.) for production-ready performance.

**Key decisions:**
- Used `varchar` for bookingDate and overrideDate (YYYY-MM-DD format) instead of MySQL `date` type for simpler string comparisons in availability queries.
- Used `decimal(10,2)` for all monetary fields to avoid floating-point precision issues.
- Booking status uses a 7-state enum: pending → confirmed → in_progress → completed, with cancelled/no_show/refunded as terminal states.

---

## Phase 2: Authentication and User Management

**Objective:** Implement role-based authentication with three user types.

**What was built:**

The Manus OAuth flow was configured (pre-built in the template). The `users` table was extended with a `role` enum supporting three roles:

- **Customer** (default): Can browse services, book appointments, leave reviews, send messages.
- **Provider**: Can create a business profile, list services, manage availability, accept/decline bookings.
- **Admin**: Full platform oversight — user management, provider verification, booking monitoring.

The `authRouter` exposes:
- `auth.me` — returns current user or null
- `auth.logout` — clears session cookie
- `auth.updateProfile` — updates user profile fields

The `useAuth()` hook on the frontend provides `user`, `loading`, and `isAuthenticated` state. The `useProtectedPage()` hook redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

**Key decisions:**
- Role is set at user creation time. Provider role is assigned when a user creates a provider profile (the `provider.create` procedure does not change the user's role — it creates a linked `service_providers` record). Admin role is auto-assigned to the platform owner via `ENV.ownerOpenId`.

---

## Phase 3: Provider Onboarding and Profiles

**Objective:** Allow users to register as service providers with business information.

**What was built:**

The `providerRouter` handles provider lifecycle:
- `provider.create` — creates a provider profile (validates no duplicate exists)
- `provider.getMyProfile` / `provider.getMine` — retrieves the current user's provider profile
- `provider.getById` — public lookup by provider ID
- `provider.list` — public listing with optional city/state/isActive filters
- `provider.listFeatured` — returns active providers sorted by rating

The **Provider Dashboard** (`/provider/dashboard`) was built with:
- Overview cards showing total services, active bookings, and average rating
- "My Services" tab listing all services with edit/delete actions
- "My Bookings" tab with status filters and booking management
- Quick action buttons for creating services and managing availability

The **Create Service** page (`/provider/services/new`) supports:
- Category selection from all 42 categories
- Four pricing models: fixed price, hourly rate, package, custom quote
- Deposit configuration (fixed amount or percentage)
- Service type selection (mobile, fixed location, virtual, hybrid)
- Duration, preparation time, cleanup time, and buffer time settings

**Key decisions:**
- Provider profiles are linked 1:1 with user accounts via `userId` unique constraint.
- Verification status starts as "pending" and must be approved by an admin.

---

## Phase 4: Service Catalog and Browsing

**Objective:** Build the public-facing service discovery experience.

**What was built:**

The `categoryRouter` provides:
- `category.list` — all active categories
- `category.getById` / `category.getBySlug` — single category lookup

The `serviceRouter` provides:
- `service.create` — provider-only service creation
- `service.getById` — public service detail
- `service.listByProvider` / `service.listByCategory` — filtered listings
- `service.search` — keyword search across service names and descriptions
- `service.listMine` — provider's own services

Frontend pages:
- **Home** (`/`) — hero section with search bar, popular category chips, featured providers
- **Browse** (`/browse`) — grid of all 42 service categories with service counts
- **Category Detail** (`/category/:slug`) — services within a specific category
- **Search** (`/search`) — keyword search with results display
- **Service Detail** (`/service/:id`) — full service information with booking calendar

**Key decisions:**
- Search is implemented as a server-side LIKE query on service name and description. For MVP this is sufficient; a full-text search index could be added later.
- Categories use URL-friendly slugs (e.g., "massage-therapist", "barber-shop") generated from the category name.

---

## Phase 5: Availability Scheduling System

**Objective:** Allow providers to define when they are available for bookings.

**What was built:**

The `availabilityRouter` provides:
- `availability.createSchedule` — set recurring weekly availability (day of week + time range)
- `availability.getSchedule` / `availability.getMySchedule` — retrieve provider schedules
- `availability.createOverride` — date-specific overrides (e.g., holidays, special hours)
- `availability.getOverrides` / `availability.getMyOverrides` — retrieve overrides

The **Manage Availability** page (`/provider/availability`) provides:
- A weekly schedule editor with day-by-day time range configuration
- An override calendar for blocking specific dates or adding special hours
- Visual display of the current schedule

The shared `timeSlots.ts` utility generates available time slots by:
1. Checking the provider's weekly schedule for the requested day of week
2. Applying any date-specific overrides
3. Filtering out slots that conflict with existing bookings
4. Returning an array of `{ time, available, bookingId? }` objects

**Key decisions:**
- Time slots are generated in 30-minute intervals by default.
- The system supports `maxConcurrentBookings` per time slot (default: 1) for providers who can serve multiple customers simultaneously.

---

## Phase 6: Booking System

**Objective:** Implement the complete booking lifecycle from request to completion.

**What was built:**

The `bookingRouter` provides:
- `booking.create` — creates a booking with automatic pricing calculation
- `booking.getById` — retrieves booking with access control (customer, provider, or admin)
- `booking.myBookings` / `booking.listMine` — customer's bookings with optional status filter
- `booking.providerBookings` / `booking.listForProvider` — provider's bookings
- `booking.listByDateRange` — bookings within a date range (for availability checking)
- `booking.updateStatus` — status transitions with cancellation tracking

The **Service Detail** page (`/service/:id`) includes a 4-step booking flow:
1. **Select Date** — calendar with visual availability indicators (green = available, gray = unavailable)
2. **Select Time** — time slot grid generated from provider availability
3. **Enter Details** — location information and customer notes
4. **Review and Confirm** — pricing summary with subtotal, platform fee, deposit, and total

The **Booking Confirmation** page (`/booking/:id`) shows:
- Booking number, status badge, and all booking details
- Payment button (Stripe checkout) for pending bookings
- Messaging link to contact the provider
- Review link for completed bookings

The **My Bookings** page (`/my-bookings`) shows:
- All customer bookings with status filters
- Booking cards with service name, provider, date, time, and amount
- Quick actions (view details, cancel, leave review)

**Pricing calculation:**
- Subtotal is based on the service's base price or hourly rate × duration
- Platform fee is 15% of the subtotal
- Total = subtotal + platform fee
- Deposit amount is calculated based on the service's deposit settings (fixed or percentage)
- Remaining amount = total - deposit

**Key decisions:**
- Booking numbers use the format `SKL-{timestamp}-{random}` for uniqueness.
- Status transitions are enforced at the API level with access control checks.
- Both customers and providers can cancel bookings, with the `cancelledBy` field tracking who initiated.

---

## Phase 7: Stripe Payment Integration

**Objective:** Enable secure payment processing for booking deposits and full payments.

**What was built:**

The `stripeRouter` provides:
- `stripe.createCheckoutSession` — creates a Stripe Checkout session for a booking

The `stripeWebhook.ts` handles:
- `checkout.session.completed` — updates booking with payment confirmation, sends email notification
- `payment_intent.succeeded` — logs successful payment
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` — logs failed payment (TODO: customer notification)
- `charge.refunded` — logs refund (TODO: booking status update)
- Test event detection (`evt_test_*`) for webhook verification

The `products.ts` file provides:
- `calculatePlatformFee(subtotal)` — 15% platform fee
- `calculateDepositAmount(total, type, amount, percentage)` — deposit calculation
- `calculateBookingTotal(servicePrice)` — full pricing breakdown

**Webhook registration:** The webhook endpoint is registered at `/api/stripe/webhook` with `express.raw()` middleware before `express.json()` to preserve the raw body for Stripe signature verification.

**Key decisions:**
- Stripe is in test mode. Users can test with card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
- Checkout sessions open in a new browser tab.
- Payment metadata includes bookingId, customerId, providerId, serviceId, and bookingNumber for reconciliation.
- Promotion codes are enabled via `allow_promotion_codes: true`.

---

## Phase 8: Messaging System

**Objective:** Enable direct communication between customers and providers linked to bookings.

**What was built:**

The `messageRouter` provides:
- `message.send` — sends a message with automatic conversation ID generation
- `message.getConversation` — retrieves all messages in a conversation
- `message.myConversations` — lists all conversations for the current user
- `message.listByBooking` — messages linked to a specific booking
- `message.markAsRead` — marks messages as read
- `message.unreadCount` — returns unread message count for the current user

The **Messages** page (`/messages/:bookingId`) provides:
- Real-time message display with 5-second polling
- Message input with send button
- Booking context header showing service and provider info
- Read receipts (messages marked as read when conversation is opened)

The **NavHeader** component displays an unread message badge across all pages.

**Key decisions:**
- Conversation IDs are deterministic: `conv-{lowerUserId}-{higherUserId}` ensures both parties share the same conversation.
- Messages are linked to bookings via `bookingId` for context.
- Polling interval is 5 seconds (a reasonable balance between responsiveness and server load for MVP).

---

## Phase 9: Review and Rating System

**Objective:** Allow customers to rate and review completed services, and providers to respond.

**What was built:**

The `reviewRouter` provides:
- `review.create` — submit a review (only for completed bookings, one per booking)
- `review.listByProvider` — paginated reviews for a provider
- `review.addResponse` — provider response to a review

The **Submit Review** page (`/booking/:id/review`) provides:
- Star rating selector (1-5)
- Text review input
- Booking context display

The **Provider Reviews** page (`/provider/reviews`) provides:
- List of all reviews for the provider
- Response form for each review
- Average rating display

Reusable components:
- `ReviewCard` — displays a single review with rating, text, and provider response
- `ReviewList` — paginated list of reviews with loading states

The `updateProviderRating()` helper recalculates and updates the provider's `averageRating` and `totalReviews` fields whenever a new review is submitted.

**Key decisions:**
- Reviews are limited to one per booking (enforced by unique constraint on `bookingId`).
- Only customers who completed a booking can leave a review.
- Provider responses are stored in the same `reviews` table (`responseText` field).

---

## Phase 10: Notification System

**Objective:** Build a multi-channel notification architecture supporting email and SMS.

**What was built:**

The notification system uses a plugin architecture:
- `NotificationService` — singleton service that routes notifications to registered providers
- `EmailProvider` — sends emails via Manus Forge API with HTML-formatted templates
- `SMSProvider` — stub implementation ready for Twilio integration
- `templates.ts` — 10 notification templates covering the full booking lifecycle

Templates implemented:
1. `new_booking_request` — sent to provider when a new booking is created
2. `booking_confirmed` — sent to customer when provider confirms
3. `booking_cancelled` — sent to customer with optional refund info
4. `booking_completed` — sent to customer with review link
5. `payment_received` — sent to customer confirming payment
6. `payment_failed` — sent to customer requesting payment update
7. `message_received` — sent when a new message arrives
8. `review_received` — sent to provider when a review is posted
9. `reminder_24h` — 24-hour appointment reminder
10. `reminder_1h` — 1-hour appointment reminder

The `notificationRouter` provides:
- `notification.list` — user's notifications with optional unread filter
- `notification.markAsRead` — marks a notification as read

**Key decisions:**
- Email HTML templates include SkillLink branding with gradient header.
- SMS bodies are kept under 160 characters for single-message delivery.
- The architecture supports adding push notifications or other channels without modifying existing code.

---

## Phase 11: Admin Dashboard

**Objective:** Provide platform administrators with oversight and management tools.

**What was built:**

The `adminRouter` provides:
- `admin.getStats` — real platform-wide statistics (total users, providers, bookings, revenue with month-over-month)
- `admin.listUsers` — paginated user list with suspension status
- `admin.listProviders` — paginated provider list with verification status
- `admin.listBookings` — paginated booking list
- `admin.suspendUser` — suspend a user account (sets deletedAt timestamp)
- `admin.unsuspendUser` — restore a suspended user account
- `admin.verifyProvider` / `admin.rejectProvider` — provider verification workflow
- `admin.updateProviderVerification` — flexible verification status update

The **Admin Dashboard** page (`/admin`) provides:
- Overview tab with stats cards (users, providers, bookings, revenue)
- Users tab with user list and suspend action
- Providers tab with verification approve/reject actions
- Bookings tab with booking list and status overview

**Key decisions:**
- Admin access is enforced at the procedure level via `adminProcedure` middleware.
- The admin role is auto-assigned to the platform owner.

---

## Phase 12: Dev and Testing Environment

**Objective:** Create a robust development and testing environment for the platform.

**What was built:**

**Test suite** (88 tests across 6 files):
- `auth.logout.test.ts` — authentication logout flow
- `platform.test.ts` — categories, providers, services, availability, bookings, auth, DB helpers (15 tests)
- `skilllink.test.ts` — comprehensive end-to-end tests for all routers (27 tests)
- `review.test.ts` — review creation, provider response, listing (3 tests)
- `next-steps.test.ts` — unread message count, booking calendar features (16 tests)
- `timeSlots.test.ts` — time slot generation utility (26 tests)

**Seed data script** (`seed-data.mjs`):
- 11 test users (1 admin, 5 providers, 5 customers)
- 6 provider profiles across different categories
- 17 services with various pricing models
- 18 bookings in various states (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- 9 reviews with ratings and provider responses
- 3 message conversations
- Availability schedules for all providers

**DevTools Panel** — floating development tool (bottom-right corner):
- Current auth status display (role, name, email, user ID)
- Quick navigation links organized by role (Customer, Provider, Admin)
- Testing workflow guide
- Platform info (categories count, commission rate, payment mode)

**Key decisions:**
- Test users use timestamp-based unique IDs to avoid collisions between test runs.
- Seed data uses high ID ranges (270000+) to avoid conflicting with production data.

## Known Gaps and Future Work

The following items are identified but not yet implemented:

1. **Service photo upload** — schema exists but no upload UI or API
2. **Verification document upload** — schema exists but no upload UI or API
3. **Provider payouts** — Stripe Connect not configured; no payout logic
4. **Refund handling** — webhook handler logs but doesn't update booking status
5. **Payment failure notification** — webhook handler logs but doesn't notify customer
6. **SMS notifications** — provider is a stub awaiting Twilio credentials
7. **Embeddable booking widget** — not started
8. **Location-based search** — not implemented

### Resolved in Phase 13 (MVP Gap Fixes)

- ~~Admin stats are hardcoded~~ → Now uses real database queries
- ~~User suspension is a stub~~ → Now sets/clears `deletedAt` timestamp
- ~~Profile update is a stub~~ → Now persists to database
- ~~Service editing/deletion~~ → Full CRUD with UI
- ~~Provider profile editing~~ → Edit form in provider dashboard

---

## Phase 13: MVP Gap Fixes and Documentation

**Objective:** Close all remaining MVP gaps, create comprehensive documentation, and ensure all user roles have complete workflows.

**What was built:**

**Backend fixes:**
- `admin.getStats` now queries real data: total users, new users this month, total providers, pending verifications, total bookings, bookings this month, total revenue, revenue this month
- `admin.suspendUser` now sets `deletedAt` timestamp on the user record
- `admin.unsuspendUser` (new) clears `deletedAt` to restore access
- `admin.rejectProvider` (new) rejects a provider with a reason
- `auth.updateProfile` now persists firstName, lastName, phone, email to the database
- `provider.update` (new) allows providers to edit business name, description, phone, address fields
- `provider.earnings` (new) returns total earnings, completed bookings, pending earnings, and recent transactions
- `service.update` (new) allows providers to edit service name, description, price, duration, and status
- `service.delete` (new) allows providers to delete their services
- `availability.deleteSchedule` / `availability.deleteOverride` (new) allow providers to remove availability entries

**Frontend additions:**
- **UserProfile** page (`/profile`) — view and edit personal information
- **AdminDashboard** — real stats, working suspend/unsuspend, verify/reject providers
- **ProviderDashboard** — service edit/delete dialogs, profile editing, real earnings data, booking status management
- **NavHeader** — profile link with user icon

**Tests:** 14 new tests in `mvp-gaps.test.ts` covering admin stats, suspension, profile updates, provider updates, earnings, service CRUD, availability deletion, and provider verification.
